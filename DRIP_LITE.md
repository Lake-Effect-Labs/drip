# Drip-lite Feature Scope

> "A simple job & estimate tracker so you don't lose work."

## The Test

**A solo painter can understand it in 30 seconds and use it daily with zero training.**

If it fails that test, it's not Drip-lite.

---

## ✅ VISIBLE (Core Value)

### 1. Board View (THE PRODUCT)
- Fixed stages: New → Quoted → Scheduled → In Progress → Done → Paid → Archive
- Drag cards between columns
- One glance = clarity
- **This is what we sell.**

### 2. Basic Job Card
Only these fields:
- Customer name
- Address  
- Job name
- Status
- Notes
- Scheduled date (simple)

### 3. Estimates (Simplified)
- Square footage input
- Rate (from settings)
- Auto-calculated total
- Accept via public link
- **No line item complexity**

### 4. Copy-to-Text (HUGE WIN)
- "Copy estimate link"
- "Copy estimate message"  
- "Copy reminder message"
- "Copy payment link"
- **This is secretly one of our best features.**

### 5. Invoices (Basic)
- Create invoice from job
- Send payment link
- Mark as paid (manual)
- **Do NOT position as "invoicing software"**

### 6. Settings (Minimal)
- Company name only
- Estimating rate ($/sqft)
- That's it.

## ❌ HIDDEN (Future Drip Pro)

### Calendar View
- Too many expectations, questions, bugs, opinions
- Jobs already imply time
- **Route exists but not in nav**

### Inventory
- Support nightmare at $49/mo
- **Save for Drip Pro**

### Customers Page
- Data still captured on jobs/estimates
- Dedicated page hidden
- **Upsell opportunity later**

### Team Management  
- Cold-email buyers = solo or tiny crews
- Adds auth issues, "why can't my guy see X?", billing questions
- **Cut from nav and settings**

### Settings Sprawl
- No themes picker
- No pickup locations
- No invite links
- No exports
- **Minimal = momentum**

---

## 🚫 DISABLED (Code Exists, Not Exposed)

- Estimate line item editing (use auto-calc only)
- Paint color/sheen/gallons fields (too complex)
- Materials checklist auto-generation (hidden complexity)
- CSV exports (enterprise feature)
- Team invite flow (solo focus)

---

## Landing Page Promise

```
Track jobs. Send estimates. Get paid.
No setup. No training. Built for painters.
```

---

## Words We NEVER Use

- CRM
- Scheduling software
- Accounting
- Inventory management
- Operating system
- All-in-one

These trigger objections, comparisons, and feature checklists. We lose instantly.

---

## What We're Actually Selling

**NOT:** "All-in-one OS for painting companies"

**YES:** "A simple job & estimate tracker so you don't lose work."

---

## Why This Will Sell

Painters already use notes, texts, and whiteboards.

We're not changing behavior. We're organizing chaos.

The copy-to-text feature alone is a closer.
