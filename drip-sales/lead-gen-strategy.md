## Best Free/Cheap Lead Sources

### 1. Google Maps Scraping (BEST)
**Tools:** 
- Outscraper.com (~$0.002 per lead)

- PhantomBuster

**Search queries:**
- "painting company" + [city]
- "house painter" + [city]

**Target cities:** Start with mid-size cities (less competition, more responsive)
- Buffalo, NY
- Rochester, NY

- Cleveland, OH
- Pittsburgh, PA
- Columbus, OH
- Indianapolis, IN
- Milwaukee, WI
- etc.

**What you get:** Company name, address, phone, website, reviews

### 2. Yelp Scraping
**How:** Outscraper or Apify also do Yelp
**Filter by:** Rating (3-5 stars), review count (5-50 = small but established)

### 3. Facebook Business Pages
**Search:** "[City] painters" or "painting company"
**Look for:** Small operations, owner-run, active but not huge

### 4. Thumbtack/HomeAdvisor/Angi Listings
These list tons of small painters
**Manual or scrape** their contractor directories

### 5. State Contractor License Databases
Many states have public databases:
- California: CSLB
- Texas: TDLR
- Florida: DBPR
Often includes business name, license holder, sometimes email

### 6. LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99/mo)
**Search:** "Owner" + "Painting" + location
**Filter:** Company size 1-10
Get direct contact with decision makers

### 7. Apollo.io (Free tier: 50 emails/mo)
Search for painting companies, get verified emails
Paid = unlimited

### 8. Hunter.io

## Email Finding Strategy

Once you have company names + websites:

1. **Hunter.io** - Find email format for domain
2. **Apollo.io** - Verify/find emails
3. **Snov.io** - Email finder + verifier
4. **Generic patterns to try:**

## Quality Signals (who to prioritize)

**Hot leads:**
- 10-50 Google reviews (established but not huge)
- Has a website (more professional)
- Website looks DIY/dated (needs help with systems too)
- Active on Facebook (owner is engaged)
- Reviews mention "owner" or specific person (owner-operated)

**Skip:**
- 0-2 reviews (too new, might not stick around)
- 500+ reviews (too big, has systems already)
- Franchise locations (can't make software decisions)
- "& Sons" with 50+ years (set in their ways)
