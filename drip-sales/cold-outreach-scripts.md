# Matte Cold Outreach Scripts

## Email Sequence

### Email 1: Initial Outreach
**Subject lines (A/B test):**
- "Quick question about [COMPANY NAME]"
- "Saw your work in [CITY] - question"
- "How are you tracking jobs right now?"

**Body:**
```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

Found [COMPANY NAME] while looking at painters in [CITY] - your work looks solid.

Quick question: how are you currently tracking your estimates and jobs? Whiteboard? Texts? Spreadsheet?

I built a dead-simple app called Matte specifically for painting crews under 10 people. No bloated features, no learning curve - just estimates, jobs, and getting paid.

Takes 5 minutes to see if it's useful for you. Want me to send a quick demo video?

### Email 2: Follow-up (3 days later)
**Subject:** Re: Quick question about [COMPANY NAME]

**Body:**
```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

Following up - I know you're busy on jobs.

Here's the 30-second pitch: Matte lets you create estimates on your phone, convert them to jobs with one tap, and track everything without switching between 5 apps.

One painter told me he was losing $2-3K/month in jobs that "fell through the cracks" before using it.

Worth a 10-minute call this week?

### Email 3: Breakup Email (7 days later)
**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**
```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

I'll keep this short - I've reached out a couple times about Matte (the job tracking app for painters).

If the timing isn't right or you've got a system that works, no worries at all. I'll stop bugging you.

But if you ever want to ditch the whiteboard/spreadsheet chaos, just reply to this email. I'm not going anywhere.

Good luck with the busy season 🎨

- Flip
```

## LinkedIn Message (if email doesn't work)

```
Hey [NAME] - saw you run [COMPANY] in [CITY]. 

I built a simple job tracking app specifically for small painting crews (not the bloated contractor software that takes months to learn).

Would you be open to a quick look? No pitch, just want to know if it solves a real problem for you.
```

## Phone Script (if you call)

**Opening:**
"Hey [NAME], this is Flip - I sent you an email about a job tracking app for painters. Got 60 seconds?"

**If yes:**
"Cool. Quick question - when a customer calls for an estimate, what do you do with that info right now? Write it down? Text yourself?"

*[Let them talk - this reveals their pain]*

**Transition:**
"Got it. So I built this app called Matte because I kept hearing painters say the same thing - estimates get lost, jobs fall through the cracks, invoicing is a nightmare. 

It's dead simple - create estimate on your phone, convert to job, track it, get paid. No BS features you'll never use.

Want me to show you in like 5 minutes?"

## Key Talking Points

**Pain points to hit:**
- Lost estimates = lost money
- Texting/notes = chaos
- Big software = overkill and expensive
- End of day = can't remember what you quoted

**Differentiators:**
- Built FOR painters, not adapted from general contractor software
- Mobile-first (because you're on job sites, not at a desk)
- Simple pricing, no per-user BS
- Actually simple (5 min to learn, not 5 weeks)

## Objection Handling

**"I've got a system that works"**
→ "Totally get it. What does that look like for you?" (Then probe for pain)

**"I'm too small, just me and one guy"**
→ "That's exactly who this is for. The big software is overkill. This is estimate → job → paid. That's it."

**"I don't have time to learn new software"**
→ "Honestly, if it takes more than 5 minutes to figure out, I failed. Can I show you real quick?"

**"What does it cost?"**
→ "[$X/month]. But more importantly - how much is one lost estimate worth to you?"

**"I'll think about it"**
→ "For sure. What's the main thing you'd need to see to know it's worth it?"
